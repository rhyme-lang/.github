# Rhyme: An Expressive Data-Centric Query Language

Rhyme is a new data-centric declarative query language designed for querying and transforming nested data structures.
It is designed to be easy to use, and to be able to express multiple paradigms of workloads
(typical data processing, visualizations, tensor computations, etc.) in a simple way while also being able to
achieve performance by constructing an IR which gets optimized and translated to efficient JS code.
